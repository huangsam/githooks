{"name":"Githooks","tagline":"Git hooks for Python projects","body":"# Introduction\r\n\r\nThese hooks are the culmination of policies that I typically\r\nenforce for Python projects. Some of these hooks utilize\r\n[flake8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8) to ensure PEP8\r\ncompliance, logical flow and an appropriate level of complexity.\r\nOther hooks utilize the `check-msg` script to ensure that\r\nproposed commit messages are formatted correctly for\r\n[JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) pull requests.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nThese Git hooks utilize a mix of Python and Shell. Python offers\r\na clean approach to procedural programming while Shell offers\r\nexcellent text processing and file management utilities.\r\n\r\nMany of the Git hooks execute the same verification tasks.\r\nAs such, common functionality is centralized into\r\n`check-msg` and `verify` for maximum code reusability and\r\nhook maintainability.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncurl -fssL huangsam.github.io/githooks/gh-install | bash\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter installation is complete all scripts and commit message template\r\nwill be available in your `.git/hooks` directory. If there are any\r\nfiles that already exist with the same name, it will be renamed\r\nto `%NAME%.bak`. The git will be configured to point to the commit\r\nmessage template.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
